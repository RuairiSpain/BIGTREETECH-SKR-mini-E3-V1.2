G1 X110 Y110; roughly center
;Paper test on Nozzle in center position (to calculate Z_offset)
M211 S0; turn off end stop restriction negative Z
G91; Use relative positioning
;--------------------------------
; Put paper under nozzle on bed
; Move nozzle up/down until you get friction on the paper under the nozzle
G1 Z-1.0; Move nozzle down 1mm
G1 Z0.1; Move nozzle up .1mm
G1 Z-0.05; Move nozzle down 0.5mm
;Keep moving until paper friction
;--------------------------------
M114; read Z offset (Z -1.25)
G92; Use absolute positioning
M851 Z-0.25; Set the Z-Offset to -1.25mm (Update Marlin source code Z-Offset value so it's stored as well just in case you re-flash your ROM)
M503; Show EEPROM on terminal
M500; Save EEPROM, no need to re-flash because saved to EEPROM, but a good backup scenario

    In Menu:
        Prepare ->
        Unified Bed Levelling ->
        Mesh Edit ->
        Displays GRID
        Scroll and select your bad coordinate
            Mesh Editor: 0.595
            Coordinate too close -> increase (Example Change coordinate from 0.595 -> 0.610)
            Coordinate too far -> decrease
            Then Marlin moves to neighbouring (8 points) es so you can adjust (smooth) mesh offsets
        Edit any other points that need fixing/editing
        Hold display scroll wheel to exit editing mesh
    In Terminal:
