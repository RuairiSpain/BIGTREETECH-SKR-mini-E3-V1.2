G29 S1; Save to mesh slot 1 (1-7 slots)
G29 F 10.0;Set fade height to 10mm, fade alows taller print to use mesh for first layers and reduce it's offset as it does each layer level, by 10mm vertically mesh is flattened
G29 A;Activate UBL. Recommended to be at least 10mm.

G1 X110 Y 110; roughly center
;Paper test on Nozzle in center position (to calculate Z_offset)
M211 S0; turn off end stop restriction negative Z
G91; Use relative positioning
;--------------------------------
; Put paper under nozzle on bed
; Move nozzle up/down until you get friction on the paper under the nozzle
G1 Z-1.0; Move nozzle down 1mm
G1 Z0.1; Move nozzle up .1mm
G1 Z-0.05; Move nozzle down 0.5mm
;Keep moving until paper friction
;--------------------------------
M114; read Z offset (Z -1.25)
G91; Use absolute positioning
M851 Z-1.25; Set the Z-Offset to -1.25mm (Update Marlin source code Z-Offset value so it's stored as well just in case you re-flash your ROM)
M503; Read EEPROM on terminal
M500; Save EEPROM, no need to re-flash because saved to EEPROM, but a good backup scenario

    In Menu:
        Prepare ->
        Unified Bed Levelling ->
        Mesh Edit ->
        Displays GRID
        Scroll and select your bad coordinate
            Mesh Editor: 0.595
            Coordinate too close -> increase (Example Change coordinate from 0.595 -> 0.610)
            Coordinate too far -> decrease
            Then Marlin moves to neighbouring (8 points) es so you can adjust (smooth) mesh offsets
        Edit any other points that need fixing/editing
        Hold display scroll wheel to exit editing mesh
    In Terminal:
        G29 T; Output new mesh to terminal

Potentially can have a skew in the bed, can tilt whole coordinate system for skew
;3 point level test
G29 L1; Load mesh from slot 1
G29 J; Check front 2 corners and back-center (triangle movement, no print)\
; Now print g-code level file, to test adhesion and mesh levels
